# Placemark POI Assignment #

This assignment was to create a placemarker POI, I decided to create POI of the rivers of Croatia.

The running website can be found here: https://fast-dusk-50301.herokuapp.com/

When signed in, the user is presented with the map page where they can see the images, name, dsesciption and location of the river.
The user can then go to the add/remove tab, where they select which category the river belongs to and can add the details of the river. The image can also be uploaded, which is uploaded to cloudinary.
The user can delete the rivers also and this can all be seen in the map page

The admin has a admin dashboard where they can see the registered users and can see how many rivers each user added. They can also delete users from the dashboard

Using Swagger, this helps to build and test restful web services. Also used JWT.
